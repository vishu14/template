This system was built to capture bicep muscle flex. With the ability to sense this signal various actuators can be driven, creating a human-machine interface. The device captured impulses with electrodes fixed on the arm with a conducting gel interface. The weak signal was then amplified by Op-Amps, passed through a band-pass filter and fed to the ADC of an arduino
