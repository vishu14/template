summary: A barcode based sorting machine for warehouses 
youtubeId: L8IIVp1OTfQ

FMCG warehouses deal with a large range of SKUs ( in the 1000's) which are sorted into bins based on customer orders. Manually sorting these high number of SKU's is cumbersome and error-prone while also being slow. Thus a barcode-based light-guided system using a raspberry pi and Arduino's, was built to assist in this process.

This system helped reduce sorting workforce by 50% and reduced sorting time by 20%.
