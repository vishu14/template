---

A Filament winding machine is used to wind thin fibers over a pattern to create a composites product. The advantage with the machine is

1) Control over the angle of wrap of the fiber </br>
2) semi-automation of the layup process </br>
3) ability to maintain the desired fiber tension while wrapping</br>
