A shallow neural network was trained using the UTIAS Multi-Robot Cooperative Localization and Mapping Dataset, by the ASRL lab.The network 
was tasked to learn the motion model of a differential drive robot.Once trained it could predict the posterior position given a control signal. This trajectory matched well to the ground-truth.
