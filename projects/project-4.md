Given real-world dynamics, it is close to impossible building a mathematical model that can predict accurately a robot's state given a control signal. Localization using sensor data is thus performed to understand the robot's posterior state. 
Particle filter is a non-parametric filter that can be used for the same. This algorithm is used to a high degree of success, again for the UTIAS Multi-Robot Cooperative Localization and Mapping Dataset, by the ASRL lab.
